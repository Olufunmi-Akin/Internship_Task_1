# Internship_Task_1

### Task : Create a look

### Objective 
Create exploratory Looks in Looker to analyze product sales and revenue by country using data from the Operating Rhythm Dashboard. This includes identifying the first product sold per country and evaluating monthly sales and revenue for 2025.

### Data Sources
The data used for this task is derived from the Operating Rhythm Dashboard in Looker. This dashboard aggregates key business metrics related to: Sales performance, Collections, Agent activity, Product sales, Geographical distribution(by country, region, etc.). Data is sourced from internal data models 

### Tools Used
- Looker

### Scope
This task involves working within Looker to explore the Operating Rhythm Dashboard and create two specific data Looks to support performance and sales analysis by geography. 
- Gaining familiarity with the Accounts and Users (Agents) data models used in the dashboard.
- Navigating to and using the "Explore from here" feature to access underlying data views.
- Creating and saving two distinct Looks:
    1. The first product sold in each country.
    2. Monthly units sold and revenue for 2025, grouped by country.
- Investigating dimension groups in Looker and understanding how time-based fields affect reporting outputs.

### Expected Impact:
The outcome of this task will contribute to deeper business insights and more effective decision-making by enabling:
- Improved visibility into product performance: Identifying the first product sold in each country can uncover launch trends and early customer preferences.
- Enhanced sales and revenue tracking: Monthly breakdowns of units sold and revenue for 2025 will support forecasting, regional strategy development, and performance benchmarking.
- Efficient use of Looker: By leveraging dimension groups and time-based filtering, stakeholders can create more dynamic, reusable, and insightful visualizations.
- Reduced manual analysis time: Reusable Looks help automate recurring queries and improve reporting efficiency across teams.
- Data-informed decision-making: Equips sales, operations, and strategy teams with trusted, timely insights tied to actual agent and product performance.
